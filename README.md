# ai-drivebook

Generates a list of cities using an LLM through an MCP server, queries OpenStreetMap to determine distances and driving routes between them, and then produces a set of weekday travel plans. The routes are automatically adjusted to match the required target distance. Finally, the tool exports the results into both CSV and XLSX output files.
